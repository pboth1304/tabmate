## Why TabMate?

Modern web applications increasingly require more sophisticated text editing capabilities, especially for technical content like code snippets.

While there are comprehensive code editors available, they often come with significant bundle size costs and much more features than you probably need for most use cases.

### Problems TabMate Solves

- **Native Limitations**: HTML textareas and contenteditable elements lack proper tab indentation behavior by default
- **Bloated Alternatives**: Full-featured code editors are often too heavy for simple indentation needs
- **Framework Lock-in**: Many editing utilities are tightly coupled to specific frameworks

### What Makes TabMate Different

- **Lightweight**: At less than 1KB gzipped, TabMate adds almost no impact to your bundle size
- **Framework-agnostic**: Works with any JavaScript application, regardless of your frontend framework
- **Focused Functionality**: Provides only what you need for tab/indentation behavior - nothing more
- **TypeScript-first**: Built with TypeScript for great developer experience and type safety
- **Zero Dependencies**: No third-party libraries are included in the production bundle

### When to Choose TabMate

TabMate is the perfect choice for you when:

- You need proper indentation behavior but don't need a full code editor
- You're building applications where bundle size matters
- You want to enhance textareas in forms, comment sections, or simple editors

**TabMate focuses on doing one thing very well - providing intuitive, code-editor-like indentation behavior for plain HTML elements - without the overhead of more complex solutions.**
